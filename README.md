# Custom-Visuals-Tableau
This repository contains dynamic code that allows users to create charts by simply dragging and dropping columns. The code utilizes HighCharts for chart rendering, but any charting library can be integrated to create various types of charts.

The base structure of the code remains consistent, so if you need to create a different chart type, you only need to replace the line chart code and make minor adjustments. The code accepts four inputs: X-axis, Y-axis, Description, and Tooltip, providing flexibility for customized data visualization.

This custom chart solution was developed as an alternative to the less modern charts available in Tableau. The charts created with this code can be imported into Tableau Desktop using the Viz Extension, a feature released in early July 2024.
